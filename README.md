# Pasword-Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a JavaScript file from scratch that would randomly gennerate a password that is greater then 8 characters but less then 128 characters. The user would be prompted witha series of questions asking if they would like their password to contain different characters like numbers, capital letters,lowercase letters, and special characters. after this input was taken the JavaScript five would then take this information to then generate a unique password that checked out the users requierments.
    while creating this project I was able to understand the importance of functions and how they can be a great tool for a programer to use. Along with that I was able to learn how you can use JavaScript to effect and or chnage and either CSS attributes or effect HTML elements directly.
